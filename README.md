[Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl) is a Julia package for probability distributions and associated functions. 

[DataFrames.jl](http://juliadata.github.io/DataFrames.jl/stable/) is a tool for working with tabular data in Julia.

[Flux.jl](https://fluxml.ai/) is an elegant approach to machine learning. It's a 100% pure-Julia stack, and provides lightweight abstractions on top of Julia's native GPU and AD support.

[IRTools.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/IRTools.jl) is a simple and flexible IR format, expressive enough to work with both lowered and typed Julia code, as well as external IRs.

[Cassette.jl](https://github.com/jrevels/Cassette.jl) is a Julia package that provides a mechanism for dynamically injecting code transformation passes into Julia’s just-in-time (JIT) compilation cycle, enabling post hoc analysis and modification of "Cassette-unaware" Julia programs without requiring manual source annotation or refactoring of the target code.
